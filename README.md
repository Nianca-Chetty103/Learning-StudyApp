# Study App ðŸ“š
As a student myself finding ways to study loads of material can be a hassle ðŸ˜µ. One day I saw an ad of gizmo learning app and as the software engineer I am, decided that I could possibly build that myself.ðŸ˜„

## Tech Stack ðŸ’»
- android studio (Java)
- Figma 

## Problems ðŸš©
- Living in a technological era with almost everything becoming distracting, its very hard to focus.
- having notes lost or disorganised can be a frustration.
- Understanding difficult topics.
- unproductive use of screen time.
  
## Solutions ðŸ’¡
My learning helps students by:
- Built-in focus timers where I could try lock other apps that make the student uproductive while using the app to study.
- Interative learning
- organised material and can't loose any notes.
- i'm going to try use AI so that it can hopefully explain to the user about topics for easier understanding.
- Will build a streak function to keep the user coming back to learn their study material.
